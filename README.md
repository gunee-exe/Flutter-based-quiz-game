🏏 Cricket Quiz App

A Flutter-based quiz app designed for cricket enthusiasts. This project is my final project, showcasing how Flutter can be used to build fun, interactive, and responsive apps.

📌 Features

🎯 Multiple-choice questions on cricket.

🔀 Randomized questions & answers to keep the quiz fresh.

📊 Score tracking system to show performance.

🖼️ Clean and responsive UI built with Flutter widgets.

📱 Cross-platform support – works on Android and can be adapted for iOS.

🎓 Key Concepts Learned

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of Flutter & Dart by implementing:

Stateful & Stateless Widgets – managing UI updates based on user interactions.

Navigation – switching between quiz screens (home, questions, results).

List & Map handling in Dart – storing questions, options, and answers.

Randomization – shuffling questions and answers for a dynamic experience.

Event handling with setState() – updating UI in real time as answers are selected.

Separation of concerns – structuring the app into multiple classes and widgets for readability.

Hot Reload – fast UI/logic testing during development.
